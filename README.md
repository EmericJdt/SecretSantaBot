Maybe you are not familiar with the concept of Secret Santa ?
A Secret Santa is a different way to offer Christmas presents, you can do it with your family, friends, etc.
All entrants will draw someone else and has to give them a present.

### How does bot works ?

Simple Workflow 
- Only two commands to run.
- Intuitive.
- No configuration needed.

One of the entrants runs the CreateSanta command :
> .createsanta [Maximal price of the present] (You can also add a little description after)

Then all entrants have to add the specific reaction to enter :
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/GrISYKd.jpg)

After all entrants are visible in the Entrants list the creator of the Secret Santa has to run the DrawSanta Command :
> .drawsanta

Eventually, everyone will recieve a private message with the name of the chosen one !
